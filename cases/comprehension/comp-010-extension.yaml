# Comprehension Case: Extending the System
# Tests whether the agent can identify extension patterns

title: "Extension Points"
type: comprehension

prompt: |
  This project likely has places where new functionality can be "plugged in"
  following existing patterns. Find the most obvious extension point and explain:

  - What pattern is used (plugin, adapter, strategy, factory, etc.)?
  - Where would I add a new implementation?
  - What interface or contract must I follow?
  - Show me an existing implementation as an example.

  Think about things like: new database adapters, new auth providers,
  new API integrations, new report types, etc.

notes: |
  A good answer will:
  - Identify a real extension point in the code
  - Name the pattern being used
  - Show the interface/contract
  - Reference an existing implementation
  - Explain how to add a new one

  This tests deep architectural understanding.
