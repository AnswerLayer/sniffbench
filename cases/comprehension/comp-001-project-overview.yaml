# Comprehension Case: Project Overview
# Tests whether the agent can understand and explain what the project is

id: comp-001
title: "Project Overview"
type: comprehension

prompt: |
  Imagine you're writing the README for this project. Help me understand:

  - What does this project do? What problem does it solve?
  - Who is it for?
  - What are the main components or modules?
  - How is the codebase organized?

  Give me the "elevator pitch" version, then a slightly deeper dive
  into the structure.

  A good answer will:
  - Correctly identify the project's purpose
  - Describe the target users/audience
  - Outline the major components
  - Explain the directory structure
  - Reference key files (README, package.json, etc.)

  This is the foundation - if the agent can't answer this,
  it can't answer anything else well.
