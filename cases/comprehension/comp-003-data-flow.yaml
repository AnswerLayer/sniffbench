# Comprehension Case: Data Flow
# Tests whether the agent can trace data through the system

title: "Tracing Data Flow"
type: comprehension

prompt: |
  Pick the most important entity or data type in this codebase
  (user, order, document, etc.) and trace its journey:

  - Where is it first created or received?
  - How does it move through the system?
  - Where is it stored (database, cache, file)?
  - How is it retrieved and returned to clients?

  Draw me a mental picture of this data's lifecycle.

  A good answer will:
  - Correctly identify a core domain entity
  - Trace it from API/input through to storage
  - Note transformations along the way
  - Reference specific files and functions

  This tests understanding of:
  - Domain model
  - Service layer organization
  - Data access patterns
