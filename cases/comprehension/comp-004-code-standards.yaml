# Comprehension Case: Code Standards
# Tests whether the agent understands the project's quality standards

id: comp-004
title: "Code Standards and Quality"
type: comprehension

prompt: |
  Help me understand the code quality standards in this project:

  - Is there linting configured? What rules does it enforce?
  - Is there code formatting (Prettier, Black, gofmt)?
  - Are there tests? What framework and patterns are used?
  - Are there type checks (TypeScript, mypy, etc.)?
  - How do I run these checks locally?

  What would I need to do to make sure my code meets this project's
  standards before submitting?

  A good answer will:
  - Identify configured linters and their config files
  - Explain formatting rules/tools
  - Describe the testing setup (if any)
  - Show how to run quality checks
  - Note any pre-commit hooks or CI checks

  If some of these aren't configured, that's a valid answer too -
  the agent should recognize what's present vs missing.
