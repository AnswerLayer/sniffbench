# Comprehension Case: Key Dependencies
# Tests whether the agent understands external integrations

title: "Key Dependencies"
type: comprehension

prompt: |
  What are the 3-5 most important external dependencies in this project,
  and how are they used?

  For each one:
  - What problem does it solve?
  - Where in the code is it used?
  - Are there any wrappers or abstractions around it?
  - Could it be replaced? How hard would that be?

notes: |
  A good answer will:
  - Identify genuinely important deps (not utilities like lodash)
  - Explain their purpose in context
  - Show where they're used
  - Note any abstraction layers
  - Assess coupling (how hard to replace)
