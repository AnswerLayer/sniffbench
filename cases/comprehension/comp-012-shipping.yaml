# Comprehension Case: Shipping Changes
# Tests whether the agent understands the deployment/release process

title: "How to Ship"
type: comprehension

prompt: |
  I've made changes and want to ship them. Walk me through:

  - How do I build the project for production?
  - Is there a CI/CD pipeline? What does it check?
  - How are releases or deployments done?
  - What environments exist (staging, production)?
  - What's the process for getting code from my branch to users?

  A good answer will:
  - Show build commands for production
  - Identify CI/CD config (GitHub Actions, etc.)
  - Explain the deployment mechanism
  - Note different environments
  - Describe the release process (if any)

  If there's no formal deployment (it's a library), explain
  the publish/release process instead.
