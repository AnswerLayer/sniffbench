title: "How to Run It"
type: comprehension

prompt: |
  I'm a user who just cloned this project. How do I run it?

  - What are the prerequisites (runtime, dependencies)?
  - What commands do I need to run to get it working?
  - How do I know it's running correctly?
  - Are there different ways to run it (dev mode, production, etc.)?

  Give me the step-by-step "getting started" guide.

  A good answer will:
  - Identify prerequisites (Node, Python, Docker, etc.)
  - Show the exact commands to install and run
  - Explain how to verify it's working
  - Note any configuration needed first

  This tests practical usability understanding.
