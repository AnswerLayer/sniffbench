# Comprehension Case: Adding New Features
# Tests whether the agent understands how to extend the codebase

title: "How to Add New Features"
type: comprehension

prompt: |
  If I wanted to add new functionality to this project, help me understand
  the patterns I should follow:

  - Where does new code typically go?
  - What's the conventional structure for a new feature or module?
  - What existing code should I look at as an example?
  - What other files typically need to change when adding something new
    (types, tests, exports, etc.)?

  Walk me through the project's conventions for extending it.

notes: |
  A good answer will:
  - Identify the conventional locations for new code
  - Point to a good example to follow
  - Note related changes (exports, index files, tests)
  - Show awareness of project-specific patterns

  Signs of good understanding:
  - References actual file paths and patterns
  - Shows awareness of project conventions
  - Doesn't assume specific project types (API, CLI, library, etc.)
