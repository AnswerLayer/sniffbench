prompt: |
  I'm a developer who wants to contribute to this project.
  Walk me through the development workflow:

  - How do I set up my development environment?
  - How do I run the project in development mode?
  - What's the edit-test-debug cycle like?
  - Are there any dev tools, scripts, or helpers I should know about?
  - How do I run tests as I work?

  A good answer will:
  - Explain dev environment setup
  - Show dev mode commands (hot reload, watch, etc.)
  - Describe the testing workflow
  - Note any dev scripts in package.json/Makefile/etc.
  - Mention debugging tools or techniques

  This tests understanding of developer experience.
