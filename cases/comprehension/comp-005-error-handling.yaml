title: "Error Handling Patterns"
type: comprehension

prompt: |
  Explain how errors are handled in this codebase:

  - When something goes wrong deep in the code, how does the error
    bubble up to the user?
  - Are there custom error types or classes?
  - How are errors logged?
  - What does the client/user see when an error occurs?
  - Is there any error monitoring or alerting?

  A good answer will:
  - Identify the error handling strategy (throw/catch, Result types, etc.)
  - Show how errors are transformed at boundaries
  - Note any custom error classes
  - Explain logging and monitoring
  - Show what API responses look like for errors
  - Respect existing styles and choices
