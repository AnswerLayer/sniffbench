# Docker Images

This directory contains Dockerfiles for creating sandboxed evaluation environments.

## Planned Images

- Python (multiple versions)
- Node.js (multiple versions)
- Go
- Rust
- Java
- Other languages as needed

Each image should be minimal but include necessary tooling for typical development tasks.
